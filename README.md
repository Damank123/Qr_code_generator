# Qr_code_generator

QR Code Generator is a Python project that offers a simple GUI application for generating QR codes based on user input. The project utilizes Tkinter for the interface, `qrcode` for creating the QR codes, and Pillow for image processing, allowing users to easily create, display, and save QR codes in PNG format.

### Libraries Used:

- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **qrcode**: For generating QR codes.
- **Pillow**: For image processing and handling.

### Steps to Create the Application:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed via pip.

2. **Set Up the Project Structure**:
   - Create a Python file (`qr_code_generator.py`) and import the required libraries.

3. **Create the Tkinter GUI**:
   - Set up the basic structure of the Tkinter window, including input fields, labels, and buttons.

4. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - **Tkinter Setup**: Initialize the main window with `Tk()`, and use `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button` widgets to create the UI.
   - **Generate QR Code**: Use the `generate_qr` function to create a QR code with specified parameters (version, error correction, box size, and border), and save it as `qr_code.png`.
   - **Display the QR Code**: Open and resize the saved QR code image using `PIL.Image.open`, convert it for Tkinter display using `ImageTk.PhotoImage`, and show it within the GUI using a `Label` widget.
   - **User Feedback**: Provide feedback to users with `messagebox.showinfo` and `messagebox.showwarning`, informing them of successful generation or errors.

5. **Running the Application**:
   - Execute the `qr_code_generator.py` script. A window will open, allowing users to enter data. The QR code will be generated, displayed, and saved as `qr_code.png`.

### Next Steps:

- **Customization**: Add features like custom QR code colors, different image formats, and user-specified save locations.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for edge cases, such as invalid input or file system errors.
- **Styling**: Enhance the GUI with `tkinter.ttk` for better styling.

This project serves as a foundational example of integrating Python libraries with a graphical user interface, providing a platform for further enhancements and learning.
