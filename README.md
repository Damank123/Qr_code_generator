# Qr_code_generator
QR Code Generator is a Python project that provides a simple GUI application for generating QR codes based on user input. Utilizing Tkinter for the interface, `qrcode` for QR code creation, and Pillow for image handling, the application allows users to easily create, display, and save QR codes in PNG format. [Link: https://github.com/Damank123/Qr_code_generator]

To create a Python app that generates QR codes with a Tkinter GUI, we'll use the following libraries:

    Tkinter: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
    qrcode: For generating QR codes.
    Pillow: For handling image processing.

I'll guide you through the project with code snippets and explanations at each step.
Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
Step 2: Set Up the Project Structure

Create a new Python file, say qr_code_generator.py, and start by importing the necessary libraries.
Step 3: Create the Tkinter GUI

We'll set up the basic structure for the Tkinter window, including the input field, labels, and buttons.
Step 4: Explanation of the Code

    Tkinter Setup:
        The Tk() function initializes the main window.
        Label, Entry, and Button widgets are used to create the UI elements.
        The pack() method is used to arrange the widgets in the window.

    Generate QR Code:
        The generate_qr function is responsible for generating the QR code.
        QRCode is used to create a new QR code object with specified parameters like version, error_correction, box_size, and border.
        The add_data method adds the input data to the QR code object.
        make_image generates the QR code image which is then saved as "qr_code.png".

    Display the QR Code:
        After saving the QR code image, it is opened using PIL.Image.open and resized for display in the Tkinter window.
        ImageTk.PhotoImage is used to convert the image into a format that Tkinter can display.
        The QR code image is then displayed using a Label widget.

    User Feedback:
        messagebox.showinfo and messagebox.showwarning provide feedback to the user, such as notifying when the QR code is successfully generated or if there was an error due to missing input.

Step 5: Running the Application

When you run the qr_code_generator.py script, a window will pop up where you can enter data. After clicking the "Generate QR Code" button, a QR code corresponding to the entered data will be generated and displayed in the window. The image will also be saved as qr_code.png in the same directory as the script.
Next Steps

    Customization: Enhance the app by adding features like custom QR code colors, saving the image to a user-specified location, or allowing different image formats (e.g., JPEG, BMP).
    Error Handling: Improve error handling to manage more edge cases, such as invalid input or file system errors when saving the image.
    Styling: Use tkinter.ttk for better styling of the GUI elements.

This project is a basic starting point for learning how to integrate Python libraries with a graphical user interface to create useful applications. Feel free to expand and modify it according to your needs!
